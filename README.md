# Deep Neural Network with Restricted Boltzmann Machine

## The project

The aim of this study is to build from scratch a Deep Neural Network with Restricted Boltzmann Machine in order to shed light on the relevance of pretraining in Deep Learning.

We started by building and testing our RBM on Binary AlphaDigits dataset, available on :

It was then about focusing on pre-trained and np pre-trained models' performances in order to find the optimal configuration.

## Overview

This repository contains :

* A Jupyter notebook with implementations and results of our DNN.
* The notebook is about to be modified in the next days to reach out the final version of the project, with explanations and interpretations, soon.
